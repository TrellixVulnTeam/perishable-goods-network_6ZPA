## Installing the code:
 - run this command from a terminal window: ```npm install```
   - when you run ```npm install``` command, you will get the following error, which you can ignore. The error is caused by the installation process for the SDK tooling, which searches for all instances of files ending in ```.cto``` . Because we have those files in the answers folder, as well as in the (correctly placed) network/models folder, npm install gets confused. It's ok, the process will still work correctly.
